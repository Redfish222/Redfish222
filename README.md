## Hi there 👋
## I am @Redfish222 and mostly work with java. I do also know javascript but I don't use it much.
## I am going for a mechanical engineering degree and will start my freshmen year at the Colorado School of Mines next year
## I am born and raised in Colorado and so it was important for me to go to college here.
## I enjoy mountain biking. Work as a lifegaurd temporarily.
