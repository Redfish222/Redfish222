## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am @Redfish222 and mostly work with java. I do also know javascript but I don't use it much. I am going for a mechanical engineering degree and will start my freshmen year at the Colorado School of Mines next year. I am born and raised in Colorado and so it was important for me to go to college here. I enjoy mountain biking and work as a lifegaurd to fund that hobby.
